The U.S. is the absolute most racist country I have ever been to and I've been to over 30 countries and lived in 6. Everything is about race and about differentiating one person from another. Ironically, it's not the white people that are racist here (as I would've imagined from the stereotype), it's actually black people. Just because your black and have been discriminated against in the past does not entitle you to use it as a reason for as to why people behave in a negative way towards you. No one CARES that you're black, it's just a skin color. You're a person, that's what people care about, so stop making everything about race, because so little of it is.", "type": "status", "id": "490886417614994_649412701762364", "status_type": "mobile_status_update"}, {"from": {"category": "Community", "name": "UMiami Secrets", "id": "490886417614994"}, "privacy": {"value": ""}, "updated_time": "2014-03-22T18:05:43+0000", "likes": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAwMDAyNjM2MjU3MjA5", "before": "MTMxMDU5NjQ3OA=="}}, "data": [{"id": "1310596478", "name": "Sarah Tester"}, {"id": "100002636257209", "name": "Percy De Los Rios"}]}, "created_time": "2014-03-22T18:05:43+0000", "message": "#4073: Truth is, I'm scared of being alone.
