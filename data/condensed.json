This occured a couple days ago and its been really upsetting me ever since.I really just want to throw it out there to see what kind of response i gets. Here goes: I'm in the library and there are these two black girls that sit down next to me and they start chatting, quietly at first but then i suppose they got more bold and so their volume increased. Basically the one girl was explaining to the other about how much she dislikes white people. I learned all about how she wants to become a doctor and only treat breast cancer patients who are black. Then I was informed that if you are not black you are white, and she hates white people. Then there was this argument for like a modern back to Africa movement where she wanted all black people to return to the homeland they came from. She followed that up by contrasting MLK with Malcolm X, basically arguing that though she respects MLK, he was wrong because he just wanted to turn the other cheek on all the hate coming from the whites and to integrate with them and forgive the wrongs they did to the blacks. Malcolm X, on the other hand, basically said \"If they don't want us then we don't want them either.\" She felt this was the proper approach. She gave the example of desegregating schools, questioning why blacks should have to go to a school with white kids who don't want them there. Then she started railing against blacks who aren't more understanding of their identity. Her examples included Black Hispanics and Caribbean Islanders of African descent. She didn't feel like these people embraced their blackness enough. Also mixed race people (I guess that means black/white mixes, because she already decided everyone is either black or white) also couldn't understand what she was talking about because they weren't in tune with their blackness enough. She even admitted that prior to coming to the U, when she was living in a predominately white area, she couldn't really understand what it meant to be black. But now that she has come here for college she has finally figured out that she just likes being with her black friends more than her white friends. Couple more examples and then I'm done, I promise: She said that it really upsets her when people claim that racism doesnt exist (is anyone sane claiming this?). Then she said that a black person cannot be racist against a white person because reverse racism doesn't exist. Then she said that the same people who were lynching blacks are our professors today, and then somehow tied that in with this gruesome mental image she had seen of a black person hanging from a tree on fire as a white person had his child go take a picture next to the tree. She summed it all up saying that her new found views have also been influenced by her classes in the African Studies Department. I'm sure there was more to her many arguments than what I'm writing and obviously I am paraphrasing what she said here. But her words have really been upsetting me for the last few days.  Do people actually think like this? Is this the theme of our African Studies department? Are her views on race being solely a black/white thing the common view? Do people really not respect MLK's message of love, peace, and forgiveness between all people, specifically races for this situation? Does anyone believe racism no longer exists, or that black people can't be racist against white people? Why does this girl think that all white people prior to 1950 wanted to kill black people? Is there a legitimate desire among American blacks to return to Africa today? Those are just a few of the issues this raised with me and I was just kind of wondering what the response from the student body, from all races, would be like.", "I'm pledging a fraternity and was raised in an all-female household; I respect women.

It's one thing to admit to being racist - that's obviously a secret - but I'm not going to post your specific \"problems\" with specific races/groups.    2) To the individuals complaining about the negativity of posts - I feel I must address this again as I am still receiving submissions regarding this: I do not \"control\" the content on this page.  It is NOT my fault if there are a disproportionate number of negative posts on here - I don't write them.  There are already pages specific to positive posts - like the compliments page - so I don't understand what purpose it would serve for me to ONLY post positive things.  That's simply not what this page is about. With a few explicitly stated exceptions, this is supposed to be a place to submit whatever you want, whether it's something you're ashamed of or proud of, a drunken indiscretion or a \"pay it forward\" moment, a crush or a complaint.  While I do censor to a small degree, mostly to avoid individuals getting blasted on here, I really want to maintain an atmosphere in which anyone can say what they want to. You all should be allowed to talk about your depression, your anger, or whatever negativity you may be feeling.  I think it would be incredibly ignorant to just pretend that the negative stuff doesn't happen by not posting it.  Come on people, it's not just going to go away if I don't post it here.  Let people get it off their chests if they want to. And by sending in complaints, you are simply contributing to the number of negative posts on here.  I have said this before, but I will repeat - if you have a problem with the negativity, submit some positivity.  That is the only way you can really make an active difference, because I am not interested in ignoring someone's secret just because it doesn't make you happy.  Additionally, it seems to me that you aren't really looking at the posts realistically.  Since receiving this complaints, I've been making a conscious effort to pay attention to the negative vs. positive posts.  There are a TON of positive posts!  It seems that some people just like to find something to complain about.  If you really have a problem with it, I encourage you to go through and find the positive posts - like I said, there are a lot - giving someone a compliment, telling a funny story, describing a happy moment, whatever; I promise you, they are there.", "I really like this guy who have been with on and off since September even tho he just uses me for sex I can't get over him and keep ending up in his bed I don't know how to get over him and I keep setting myself up to get hurt!", "Faryn Solomon saved my life and she doesn't even know it", "If you think that the 1-2 times a day you accidentally inhale smoke from smokers on this campus counts as \"second hand smoking\" you're probably a dumb piece of shit who shouldn't go to this school.

I just wanted to know who you were so I could give you a hug and tell you that you're not alone. It's been almost two years since I was able to leave my abusive household and break free, but the journey of getting out and becoming my own person was one of the toughest experiences I've had in my entire life. I know all too well what it's like to have your dad break out into a rage and hit you with whatever is convenient. I've had bruises covering my whole body, and I would show up to school in the summer with full sleeves and long pants just to cover them. But the physical abuse wasn't the worst. It was the mental and emotional abuse that got to me. The bruises fade but the words don't. But I'm not here to tell you that I have been through the same thing and just leave. I'm here to tell you that I've been through the same hell as you and I fought my way to get out. My senior year of high school I fell into a depression and got into some bad drug habits, and I wasn't myself anymore. I went from being a high achiever, to someone who didn't give a shit and started failing their classes and dropped (or got dropped from) almost every leadership position they had. But I fought the urges to become complacent because I knew I had to break the cycle of abuse. Instead of my dad doing it to me, I realized I was doing it to myself. I talked to adults that I trusted and I got help for my drug habits and depression through counseling. It's not an option for everyone, I understand, but having someone you can talk to really does make a huge difference. If you have this option, please utilize it. I also started writing down all of my feelings and started to do the little things that I loved again: cooking, watching funny movies/shows, using my Pinterest, anything to get my mind off of what was going on around me. Obviously it didn't take me away, but it took my mind off of things in my darkest of moments. I am proud that you are doing what you can to survive and break the cycle of abuse. 50% of people let it consume them and then their future relationships. It will be tough in the future: trusting people, making new friends, wondering what it would be like to be \"normal,\" but you figure those things out along the way. For now, know that you might be weathering the storm, but if you can get yourself through it, you come out a better person and it will make all the relationships you do choose to pursue (professional, social, romantic) that much more meaningful and stronger.

It seemed like no one really understood what you were trying to say and I agree with you so much I'm going to try to enlighten some people that commented some rude things but added no argument whatsoever.   Most virgins that I've spoken to aren't virgins because they haven't had the chance to have sex. They are virgins because some sort of inbred line of thinking tells them that having sex just because is wrong. Not all girls are waiting to get married, some are just waiting for the right guy. That's totally okay. It's fine to be a virgin. Everyone should have sex when they feel that they are ready. That wasn't the point, nor the problem.   The problem is the CONCEPT of virginity, the value our society places on girls staying virgins. Many of these virgins, strongly believe that having sex will make them less pure. They think that it's wrong, that they will loose something if they have sex. They feel special because they've waited. They think they will be of less value if they have sex for the first time. Sometimes they are condescending towards other women that actively have sex. These women aren't necessarily whores, they're adults who are comfortable with their sex lives and take care of their bodies. They want to have sex so they do. And that's it. If you're a virgin, it should be because you aren't ready to have sex. You shouldn't remain a virgin because you are safeguarding your hymen. You shouldn't be a virgin because society and religion is sexist.   'I'm a virgin.' If you use it as a sort of  'status' then you are a virgin for the wrong reasons. You shouldn't be praised for being a virgin. There's nothing wrong with it, nor nothing commendable about it either. It just means that you haven't had sex yet, and that's okay.

Once I finally did though, I found my niche. And after spending a year in Greek Life I am 100% sure that the sorority that chose me is truly the one for me, not the one I thought I wanted after a week of superficial recruitment conversations.

The reason why black greek life was created was because white sororities and fraternities didn't allow blacks in them! Blacks wanted to enjoy the benefits of a sisterhood and brotherhood so they started their own in the early 1900s which, as you can see, has continued to grow and expand. There's a deep history embedded within black greek life which is drawn upon significant aspects of black history and black culture. Also, there's some fundamental differences between black greek life & white greek life which is what makes the two so distinct from each other (other than the race difference). Such as the signature stepping and dancing associated with all black frats and sororities and the fact that there are no \"bigs\" or \"littles\" in black greek life just to name a few. As for you saying that it is clear that white people arent as welcome in black frats or sororities, you are absolutely wrong. There have been and still are white people in the black sororities and fraternities at UM and at colleges all across the nation. It's not that they're not welcome, it's just that many white people choose not to join black greek life because they don't see themselves fitting in an organization that is predominantly black. Similarly to how many blacks choose not to join white greek life. It's all about where you fit in. And there's nothing wrong with that.

I never needed a sorority to make friends, I just did it because everyone else did it.. It was the freshman girl move. Though I enjoy my sorority at times (rare times), I have and always will beleive it was never the perfect fit for me. I am thoroughly dissapointed. The girls are all so boring and never get out of their box in fear of being too \"out there\" or \"different\". When I suggest a new idea, shirt design, or different  way of doing something it is shot down or dismissed based on the bylaws or procedures. Very little room for creativity exists within sorority life as everyone is encouraged to not stand out. People get positions not based on leadership, but who you are friends with... And most of these positions mean nothing anyway!! Worst of all, the girls that have \"big positions\" are on a major power trip and treat their sisters with disrespect which is beyond ridiculous. UM is not the traditional southern school and I cannot stand participating in southern sorority rituals/activities either..... Although I have met several of my best friends from joining, other than that I don't know why I am still in it-. I don't know where my $500 a semester goes either. I'm certainly no quitter but wow... Being in my sorority only works in your favor  if you are completely incapable of making friends aka socially inept and have a bullshit major so you can spend your precious time designing bullitin boards and planning your next frat philanthropy \"victory\". Girls In my sorority think they're hot but there is NOTHING special about them.. They all blend into the wall and are just so vanilla.. If you plan to join Greek life.. Take everything with a grain of  salt. Make your impact in other clubs and orgs, get to know as many people as possible-- in and out of Greek life. Focus on your classes, not \"recruitment 2014\". It's all BULLSHIT! Not all of your \"sisters\" are fun people, nor do they truly care about you. Remaining true to yourself is the most important thing.. And that is why I know who I am--unique, smart, creative, and different--even though I'm part of something so uniform. I know I sound like a bitch.  I am sometimes, as all girls are.

Guys are friendlier, but they just end up wanting to hook up and not caring about friendship. I became a part of Greek life because I felt like I wasn't enjoying my college experience despite all that I was doing to be involved. It really does give you a home away from home, build your confidence, provide you with opportunities, and allow you to meet people you never would have met otherwise. And that's not limited to who is in your specific fraternity/sorority, because being a part of Greek life gets you more involved with the community automatically.

Like 7, 8, 9, or 10 pm?\"  We're interested to hear your thoughts on this.    While this is certainly possible, part of the reason we post secrets on multiple occasions over the day is to keep from bombarding you with 50 secrets at a time, clogging your news feed.  Our thoughts were that if we post smaller numbers at a time multiple times throughout the day, they would be less annoying and, at the same time, promote more people to submit their own secrets.  We have found that we get the most submissions right after we post.    We do understand why it might be beneficial to have a single release time, however, we try to post secrets quickly since some are time-sensitive (like #616: To the girl in the black, Partially see-through dress sitting on the fourth floor of the business school library, who the heck are you?!), and would no longer be relevant if posted days later.  And if we were posting at a single scheduled time each day, there is no way we could post all the secrets we receive in a day at once without seriously pissing all of you off for clogging up your news feeds.  Today, for instance, we've already received more than 20 secrets, and this will likely more than double by the end of the day.

I'm also a freshman, and up until a month ago I hated being here. I hated the douchebags who would just go out all the time, get trashed, not actually enjoy themselves, but pretend to (Because let's be serious, that's most freshmen). I would constantly be disappointed by people who I thought were interesting, quickly become those same douchebags because they thought they had to do it to fit in. I've even seen people who know they're empty inside, drink themselves nearly to death to try and fill that space. It's extremely depressing because \"\"fun\"\" now is getting yourself so messed up you're not even conscious anymore, just so you can't experience your life. And I wasn't about that. I thought I was the only one, and that was extremely disheartening.  So I decided to join a few clubs. Most of them didn't work out as I ran into those same people, but I stumbled across Video Games Club. And met some of the nicest, realest people I've seen in my entire life. And it wasn't just there. By going to different events you run into people who look at life differently and can be genuinely interesting. Now, I'm not telling you to join VGC or go to a ton of events if you don't want to. But don't write off everyone just yet. There are very amazing people who go to this school who are just as fed up as you are by not finding anyone of substance and are looking for true friendship.

The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10.

First, I would like to apologize for any inappropriate comments made on secrets from this page. We introduced a new admin a couple of days ago who used the page inappropriately to post their own opinions (which we generally refrain from doing) on secrets under the page's name rather than their own personal profile. Because of these events and a few submissions and messages we received complaining about these comments, this admin no longer has access to the page as of this morning.  Secondly, we would like to share our censorship policy with you all so you are aware. In the past, when we were receiving fewer submissions, it was possible to post every individual secret. Now as volume has increased, we simply can't post every single one. If your submission makes no sense, we won't post it. Additionally, now that the page has a greater audience, we have to be more careful about what kind of information gets posted. A week or so back, a secret was posted directed at an individual. This individual reported the post and the page and we were threatened with removal and blocked from posting for 24 hours. In order to avoid this happening in the future, we are trying to avoid insulting or offending specific individuals by posting secrets clearly directed at them. Sometimes we simply remove the name or shorten it until it is unrecognizable, but due to the high volume of posts we had to simply scrap some of them, or they got skipped with the intent to post when we had time to do more thorough screening. Essentially, the risk of being reported and the page being removed is too great to post a particularly insulting secret. When the volume of submissions is lower, as it is now, we are able to actually edit posts to remove specific names or whatever needs to be done to make things postable, but this cannot be done during peak times (like around finals).   We'd also like to apologize to anyone whose submissions did not get posted during the influx of submissions we received during finals. Please resubmit if you would like and we will post it for you.  We apologize for any offense, inconvenience, or insult we may have caused, and welcome any feedback you have on these issues. You are always welcome to message us or ask us to remove a post you find offensive and we will honor that.  As always, feel free to message this page to get in touch with an admin or submit a secret directed for us to read rather than post.", "I've seen a lot of posts on this page about people having crushes on their TA's.

He was poised behind me ready to go when he paused for a second and I asked if I was ready. Sweat was rolling down my face and I knew that I wouldn't be able to contain myself any longer. I smile crept across my face and without turning to look at him I replied \"you're not\". Thats when I open sesamee'd my butt cheeks. What came out of me was not quite liquid yet not quite solid. It was a testament to natural selection; a showcase of what millions of years of engineering allows the human body to do. My boyfriend was quite literally blown away by it. I stood up and told him to never cheat on anyone again. I pranced out of the room singing That's What You Get by Paramore. I took one last look behind me to assess the damage. I nearly choked on the smell of it as it caused both of my eyes to tear up. Between my coughs I saw that my carefully designed bum smoothie had soiled my boyfriend, the bed, carpet, and curtains, and was even dripping from the ceiling. Turns out he wasn't cheating on me and once I agreed to pay for all the cleaning we decided to stay together. Ladies if this happens to you he's a keeper :)", "Had sex in a tree last night.

There's ice sculpturing competitions, snow angel competitions, but the biggest event is the Snow War. My grandma Olga was the champion of the event for 22 years. She was an incredible snow ball maker. Once she retired from participating in the Snow War she would teach me her ways. But no matter how much she taught me and how hard i practiced, I was the worst Snow Fighter in the Snow War. I was the laughing stock of my village. Every year during the festival, I would be the first one eliminated. No one knew how bad I was crying bc you can't tell frozen tears apart from leftover snow ball on your face. I left my village because I was a disappointment to my grandma. I came to UM because it never snows here. I never wanted to see snow again. Last week I got a call from my village. My grandma was on her death bed. Poor Grandma Olga. I just wanted to make her proud of me. In the afternoon before Canes After Dark, I found out that God had gained the best Snow Fighter that ever was. I was crying in my dorm when my roommate told me I should go to Canes After Dark to take my mind off of it. So I went and I saw the snow. I hoped I would never see it again. My roommate wanted me to go play with the snow, but I couldn't!!! He told me to over come my fears. He told me to do it in honor of Grandma Olga!!! When I touched the snow, I felt Grandma Olga with me. I constructed a snow ball worthy of Grandma Olga's hands. Just then, I saw a girl leave her ribs unprotected. Grandma Olga always said \"Leave the face, attack the ribs.\" And so I hurled that impeccable snow ball as hard as I could. As I saw the pain on your face, I knew I had made Grandma Olga proud.  P.S.

In fact, Black people have suffered quite a bit only about 60-70 years ago during the Civil Rights Movement. But I think the reason that people say that Black people should \"get over slavery\" is because some Black people believe they deserve some kind of extra benefit for their ancestors suffering. For example, the poor Black and Hispanic minorities groups in South Florida receive government aid, welfare and child support. This money comes from the taxes that the working class people have to pay. My mom is a physical therapist and she has over 20+ years of experience with working with these individuals. She has found that many of them do not use the money for the right reasons, such as buying IPhones, nice \"kicks\" (AKA shoes), a fancy weave/ hairdo, and other materialistic things. When my mom asks them why they are buying these things, many of them reply that their people have suffered long enough and they should finally be rewarded. Yes, your ancestors suffered from slavery, but you personally did not. It happened over 100 years ago so there is no way you went through slavery. This is unfair and a very wrong reasoning. I'm not trying to be racist, this is just the unfortunate reality that these people think this way. They bring the racism and slavery card to victimize themselves and justify why they should get better treatment. There are other ethnic groups that have suffered as well. The Jewish people lost nearly 6,000,000 of their people during the Holocaust, but rarely do hear them complaining or bringing that up. The Chinese suffered dearly during World War II when Japan invaded them. They were brutally killed, the women were raped, and they were humiliated. But no one ever mentions that, in fact I don't think many even realize that the Chinese suffered during that time. There are so many more instances throughout history that ethnic groups have been persecuted. It's important to learn from the past so we don't make the same mistake, but it also important to put the past aside, and look for a better future. We should not bring up the past to justify why we victimize ourselves. Our weaknesses is our own, we should own up to our faults and try to fix ourselves.", "Is it too much to ask for a girl with seven evil ex boyfriends who I have to engage in combat to win her heart?

First of all, I would just like to say that I go down the list of submissions in order and only remove those that violate my rules (address an individual by name, don't make any sense, attempt to use the page as a free/for sale page, etc.) so if there are a lot of negative posts in a row - I'm not ultimately responsible for that.    Secondly, I think it's very important to see both the good and the bad.  It's great to see secrets about someone's random act of kindness that reaffirms our faith in humanity or a lighthearted funny story.  But to ignore the negative would not make it go away.  This page is a platform for anonymous confession, and I am not going to dictate that individuals can only use it for their positive confessions. Someone has just as much right to use this page to vent about how much they hate their roommate, how they're struggling with classes, or their immorality.    If you all would like me to, I can try to balance out the secrets and not post a ton of negative in a row, and mix in future positive posts to temper it.  However - please keep in mind that this could mean a greater wait time for posts and fewer posted at a time, as it would mean I couldn't just go straight down the list of submissions in order.    As always, I will remove secrets if an individual requests that I do so.

Nobody has to know, people would probably run and leave me to deal with a normal person, and because I've gotten so good at acting, I can even convince myself that it's not a factor at times. Yes, it makes it almost impossible to truly relate to others because the concept of someone feeling anything positive towards me is foreign and unimaginable, but again, acting can solve that.

It's partly why I'm going into healthcare, so I can convert all of the hatred and rage into caring, or what I think it should be.
